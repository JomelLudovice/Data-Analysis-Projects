# Cebu City Airbnb Market Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Airbnb market in Cebu City, Philippines** to understand listing characteristics, pricing behavior, booking trends, and occupancy performance.

**Airbnb** is an online marketplace that connects hosts who offer short-term accommodations with guests seeking temporary lodging. It operates as a **digital platform**, enabling hosts to list properties and travelers to book stays through a web or mobile application.

**Market analysis** in this context involves examining supply, demand, pricing, and performance patterns across listings to identify trends, opportunities, and competitive dynamics within the short-term rental market.

By combining **SQL Server, Excel, and Power BI**, this project transforms raw listing and booking data into a structured, multi-page dashboard that delivers actionable insights for hosts, investors, and property managers.
