# Beauty & Skincare Ecommerce Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a beauty and skincare e-commerce dataset to evaluate **sales performance, customer behavior, product demand, and discount effectiveness**. The analysis translates transactional data into actionable insights to support **pricing strategy, product mix optimization, and promotional decision-making** in an online retail context.

---

## Objectives
- Assess overall sales and revenue performance across the e-commerce platform  
- Understand customer purchasing behavior and product-level contribution  
- Evaluate the impact of discounts on sales volume and profitability  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server:** Exploratory data analysis  
- **Power BI:** Data modeling, DAX measures, calculated columns, and interactive dashboard development  

---

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard is organized into three pages that move from **high-level performance** to **behavioral and pricing drivers**:
1. Overview  
2. Customer & Product  
3. Discount Analysis

## 1. Overview Page

**Key Findings:**
- **Revenue Growth with Volatility:** Sales peaked in **2022 ($318.7K)** before declining in **2023 ($279.9K)**, indicating growth momentum followed by demand softening.
- **Profit Concentration by Market:** **Europe (31%)** leads profitability, while Asia Pacific and USCA contribute evenly (21% each), highlighting regional differences in margin efficiency.
- **Category Performance Gap:** **Body Care** dominates sales and profit, while **Home & Accessories records losses despite high sales**, signaling pricing or cost misalignment at the category level.

## 2. Customer & Product
<img width="1537" height="855" alt="02_customer product_page_2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bee32d1-d2bf-47db-9cb6-cb4f6ed977a9" />

**Key Findings:**
- **Segment Dependence:** The **Corporate segment** drives the majority of both sales ($3.8M) and profit ($0.6M), making it the primary revenue engine.
- **Customer Base Concentration:** The **United States accounts for the largest customer base**, significantly outpacing other countries, indicating geographic demand concentration.
- **Product Profitability Imbalance:** Top-selling products generate outsized revenue, while several subcategories deliver **negative profit**, revealing inefficiencies within the product mix beyond Home & Accessories.

---

## 3. Discount Analysis

**Key Findings:**
- **Profit Erosion from Discounts:** Discounted transactions represent **45% of sales volume** but contribute only **6% of total profit**, confirming that discounts heavily dilute margins.
- **Discount Threshold Risk:** Profit declines sharply beyond **20% discounts**, with losses emerging at **31%–80%+**, indicating an unsustainable discount range.
- **Regional Discount Sensitivity:** Discounts drive **negative profit in Asian regions**, while full-price sales in Eastern and Southern Asia remain profitable—suggesting demand strength without price reductions.

---

## Recommendations
- **Correct Margin Leakage:** Reprice or renegotiate cost structures for loss-making categories, particularly Home & Accessories.
- **Defend Core Profit Drivers:** Prioritize inventory and full-price positioning for high-margin categories such as Body Care.
- **Concentrate on High-Value Segments:** Strengthen retention and tailored offerings for the Corporate segment, the primary revenue and profit contributor.
- **Control Discount Depth:** Cap discounts at **20%**, as deeper promotions consistently erode profitability.
- **Localize Pricing Strategy:** Reduce discount reliance in Asian markets and focus on full-price demand where margins remain positive.
- **Streamline Product Portfolio:** Rationalize persistently unprofitable SKUs to improve overall margin efficiency.

---

## Notes
- This project emphasizes **performance drivers and profitability trade-offs** across customers, products, and pricing strategies.
- Visuals are included to demonstrate how analytical findings translate into **business-relevant insights**, not just descriptive metrics.
